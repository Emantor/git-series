.SH NAME
git-series \- track changes to a patch series with git

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBgit series\fR [\fISUBCOMMAND\fR] [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBgit series\fR tracks changes to a patch series over time.
\fBgit series\fR also tracks a cover letter for the patch series, formats the
series for email, and prepares pull requests.

Use \fBgit series start\fR \fIseriesname\fR to start a patch series
\fIseriesname\fR.
Use normal \fBgit\fR commands to commit changes, and use \fBgit series
status\fR to check what has changed.
Use \fBgit series cover\fR to add or edit a cover letter.
Use \fBgit series add\fR and \fBgit series commit\fR (or \fBgit series commit
-a\fR) to commit changes to the patch series.
Use \fBgit series rebase -i\fR to help rework or reorganize the patch series.
Use \fBgit series format\fR to prepare the patch series to send via email, or
\fBgit series req\fR to prepare a "please pull" mail.

Running \fBgit series\fR without arguments shows the list of patch series,
marking the current patch series with a '*'.

.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.TP
\fBgit series add\fR \fIchange\fR...
Add changes to the staging area for the next \fBgit series commit\fR.
.RS
.TP
\fIchange\fR...
Changes to add: any combination of "series", "base", and "cover".
.RE

.TP
\fBgit series base\fR [\fB-d\fR|\fB--delete\fR] [\fIbase\fR]
Get or set the base commit for the patch series.
With no parameters, print the hash of the base commit.
With parameters, set or delete the base commit.

This only changes the base in the working version of the patch series; use
\fBgit series add base\fR to add that change to the next \fBgit series
commit\fR, or use \fBgit series commit -a\fR to commit the new base and all
other changes to the series in one step.
.RS
.TP
\fIbase\fR
New base commit.
This can use a commit hash, ref name, or special syntaxes such as refname^ or
refname~2.
.TP
.BR -d | --delete
Delete the current base commit.
.RE

.TP
\fBgit series checkout\fR \fIname\fR
Resume work on the patch series \fIname\fR; check out the current version as
HEAD.

.TP
\fBgit series commit\fR [\fB-a\fR|\fB--all\fR] [\fB-m\fR \fImessage\fR] \
[\fB-v\fR|\fB--verbose\fR]
Record a new version of the patch series.
Without arguments, this will run an editor to edit a commit message, and then
commit the changes previously added with \fBgit series add\fR.
.RS
.TP
.BR -a | --all
Commit all changes, not just those added with \fBgit series add\fR.
.TP
\fB-m\fR \fImessage\fR
Use \fImessage\fR as the commit message, rather than running an editor.
.TP
.BR -v | --verbose
Show a diff of the commit in the editor, below the commit message, as a
reminder of the changes in the commit.
This diff will not appear in the commit message.
.RE

.TP
\fBgit series cover\fR [\fB-d\fR|\fB--delete\fR]
Create or edit the cover letter for the patch series.
Without arguments, this will run an editor to edit the cover letter.

This only changes the cover letter in the working version of the patch series;
use \fBgit series add cover\fR to add that change to the next \fBgit series
commit\fR, or use \fBgit series commit -a\fR to commit the new cover letter and
all other changes to the series in one step.
.RS
.TP
.BR -d | --delete
Delete the cover letter rather than editing it.
.RE

.TP
\fBgit series delete\fR \fIname\fR
Delete the series \fIname\fR, including any work in progress, staged or unstaged.

.TP
\fBgit series detach\fR
Stop working on any patch series.
Any changes in progress, staged or unstaged, will remain intact.
To start working on the branch again, use \fBgit series checkout\fR.

.TP
\fBgit series format\fR [\fB--stdout\fR]
Prepare the patch series to send via email.
This creates one file per patch in the series, plus one additional file for the
cover letter if any.
The patch series must have a base set with \fBgit series base\fR, to identify
the series of patches to format.

Each file contains one email in mbox format, ready to send, with email headers
threading all the patches together.
If the series has a cover letter, all of the patches will include headers to
make them a reply to the cover letter; otherwise, all of the patches will
include headers to make them a reply to the first patch.
.RS
.TP
.B --stdout
Write the entire patch series to stdout rather than to separate patch files.
.RE

.TP
\fBgit series help\fR [\fIsubcommand\fR]
Show help for \fBgit series\fR or a subcommand.
Without arguments, shows a summary of the subcommands supported by \fBgit
series\fR.
.RS
.TP
\fIsubcommand\fR
Show help for \fIsubcommand\fR.
.RE

.TP
\fBgit series log\fR [\fB-p\fR|\fB--patch\fR]

.RS
.TP
.BR -p | --patch

.RE

.TP
\fBgit series rebase\fR [\fB-i\fR|\fB--interactive\fR] [\fIonto\fR]
Rebase the patch series, either onto a new base, interactively, or both.
The patch series must have a base set with \fBgit series base\fR, to identify
the series of patches to rebase.
.RS
.TP
\fIonto\fR
Commit to rebase the series onto.
This can use a commit hash, ref name, or special syntaxes such as refname^ or
refname~2.
.TP
.BR -i | --interactive
Interactively edit the list of commits.
This uses the same format and syntax as \fBgit rebase -i\fR, to allow
reordering, dropping, combining, or editing commits.
.RE

.TP
\fBgit series req\fR [\fB-p\fR|\fB--patch\fR] \fIurl\fR \fItag\fR
Generate a mail requesting a pull of the patch series.

Before running this command, push the patch series to the repository at
\fIurl\fR, as a tag or branch named \fItag\fR.

A pull request for a signed or annotated tag will include the message from the
tag.  The pull request will also include the cover letter if any, unless the
tag message already contains the cover letter.  The subject of the mail will
include the first line from the cover letter, or the name of the series if no
cover letter.

The patch series must have a base set with \fBgit series base\fR, to identify
the series of patches to request a pull of.
.RS
.TP
\fIurl\fR
URL of the repository to pull from.
.TP
.TP
\fItag\fR
Name of a tag or branch to request a pull from.

and hints about the next commands to run.

.TP
\fBgit series unadd\fR \fIchange\fR
